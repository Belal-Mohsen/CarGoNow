The Car Rental Management Desktop Application will include the following features and functionality:

- User Management:

  - Administrator and employee roles with authentication.

  - User profile management.

- Vehicle Management:

  - Add, edit, and delete vehicles with details (make, model, year, etc.).

  - Vehicle availability status tracking.

  - Maintenance and service scheduling.

- Reservation Management:

  - Make, modify, or cancel reservations.

  - Calendar view for availability.

- Rental Transactions:

  - Check-in (Reservation) and check-out (Return) vehicles.

  - Generate rental agreements and invoices.

- Customer Management:

  - Add and manage customer profiles.

  - Customer history.

- Reporting and Analytics:

  - Generate reports on revenue, reservations, and vehicle usage.

  - Visualize data for business insights.

- Security:

  - Data encryption and access controls.

  - Backup and recovery mechanisms.

**End Users:**

- Administrators: They will manage the overall system, including user accounts, vehicle inventory, and reports, as well as they have access to the same responsibilities of a regular employee.

- Employees: Responsible for handling reservations, check-ins (reservations), check-outs (returns), and customer interactions.

- Customers: Those renting and returning vehicles and making reservations.

**Integration of End Users with the Project (User Stories):**

- Administrator User Story: As an administrator, I want to be able to add and manage employee accounts, view reports on rental
  transactions, and monitor vehicle maintenance schedules as well as having access to the regular employee's responsibilities.

- Employee User Story: As an employee, I want to easily check vehicle availability, make reservations for customers, and generate rental agreements.

- Customer User Story: As a customer, I want to ask to browse available vehicles, make reservations, and view my rental history.

**Areas Covered by This Project:**

- Vehicle Management: Complete control over vehicle inventory and status.

- Reservation and Rental: Reservation and rental processes.

- Data Analytics: Business insights through reporting and data visualization.

- Security: Ensuring data integrity and privacy.

- User Management: User authentication and authorization.

> **Project Users, Actors, Vendors, Actuators**

- Users:

  - Rental Agents: Users who interact with the application to rent out vehicles, manage reservations, and handle customer inquiries.

  - Fleet Managers: Users with administrative privileges who oversee the vehicle inventory, maintenance, and pricing.

- Actors:

  - Payment Gateway: An external actor responsible for processing payments securely when customers rent vehicles (cash, card, e-transfer).

  - Government Registration System: An external actor that verifies and updates vehicle registration information as required by law.

- Vendors:

  - Vehicle Suppliers: Vendors who provide the car rental agency with various vehicles to include in their fleet.

  - Software Providers: Vendors that supply software components and updates for the desktop application.

  - Maintenance Services: Vendors responsible for servicing and maintaining the rental vehicles.

- Actuators:

  - Reservation and Booking Module: Part of the desktop application that handles customer reservations and booking confirmations.

  - Billing and Invoicing System: Generates invoices, calculates rental fees, and processes payments.

  - Maintenance Scheduler: Tracks vehicle maintenance schedules and alerts fleet managers when service is due.

  - Reporting and Analytics Tools: Provides insights into rental trends, revenue, and fleet performance.

> **Project Properties:**

The project will be developed using C# for programming and MySQL for the database. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) will be employed to create modern and visually appealing user interfaces (UIs) with flexible styling and layout options. WPF simplifies data binding, making it seamless to integrate and update data within the UI. Furthermore, WPF ensures resolution independence, ensuring the application looks fantastic on various screen sizes and resolutions. GitHub will serve as the source control platform, enabling easy collaboration and version control and Google Drive will be acts as a shared storage for the team.

- Programming Language: C#.

- Database: MySQL.

- Framework: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

- Source Control: [GitHub](https://github.com/dianamajolli/CarGoNow)[.](https://github.com/dianamajolli/CarGoNow)

- Shared Storge: Google Drive folder.
